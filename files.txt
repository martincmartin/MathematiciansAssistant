***** Foundations

Expression.py: Defines expressions, doesn't import any other MA file.

Parser.py: Parses expressions.  Imports only Expression.py

MatchAndSubstitute.py: Pattern matching and substitution functions on
    Expressions.  Only imports Expression.py

***** Deduction

All of these are build on Expression and MatchAndSubstitute.

ProofSystem.py: Common code from different Deduction files, e.g. ExprAndParent.

DeductionOrig: Not used, should probably be deleted.  Contains path_length(),
but that's not used anywhere.  I should probably put path_lenght() in a separate
file and delete the rest.

DeductionApril2018.py: A rewrite of DeductionOrig.py, actually used by
DummitAndFoote.py and maybe by Algebra.  Contains only try_rules, because all
support classes are now in ProofSystem.py.

DeductionCalcMode.py: I'm currently working on this (April 2022).  Deduction for
calc mode: deriving a set of terms (i.e. expressions of type "number", or maybe
"object" or at least "not proposition")

GuidedSearch.py: Not used.

***** Applications

DummitAndFoote.py: solving the problems in the classic Abstract Algebra text.
Uses DeductionApril2018.

Algebra.py: Before we can solve the DummitAndFoote problems, we need to learn
middle school algebra, and pre-algebra.
