So try_rule implements modus ponens, i.e. if the rule is of the form P => Q,

if the target is Q, it returns P.  In fact, it represents a generalized form

    # variables in formulas are assumed to correspond to specific objects in

    # either true or false in a given interpretation."
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic#Free_and_bound_variables
    # So essentially a formula with a free variable is a kind of predicate,
    # where the truth value depends on what the free variable refers to.
    #
    # So I think I want my interpretation of free variables to be a little
    # different.  I think they're understood to come from existential
    # elimination.  That is, we know the existence of them, although perhaps
    # not the uniqueness?  And there's a specific formula that introduces
    # them.  So, for example, we can define b by "7 + b == 0", and that
    # formula is only added to the "definitions" section if we know such a
    # thing exists.
    #
    # I guess what I'm proposing is having a separate "definitions" list,
    # and what logic texts call the final proposition that doesn't have the
    # witness, I'd form by adding an existential quantifier over my
    # definitions and ANDing them to the conclusion?  In other words,
    # when the hypothesis is x + 7 == 11, I might conclude x == 11 + b where
    # 7 + b == 0; the traditional way of stating this is "exists b: 7 + b ==
    # 0 and x == 11 + b."  I'm happy with that, I think.
